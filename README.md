# Nor2Doom
Nor2Doom is an interactive game to educate about low-level computer science and how computers work in general by building the "doom game" from scratch (as the final level). It starts from absolute scratch, i.e., by building a computer using logic gates, then building an assembler, then a high-level programming language, etc.

### This project is in its early stages of development, and everything is subject to change.
